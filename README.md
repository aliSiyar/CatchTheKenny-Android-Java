# CatchTheKenny-Android-Java

This is a simple Android game app where the user has to click on a moving image button (Kenny) to increase their score. The game has a time limit of 10 seconds, after which an alert dialog appears asking the user if they want to restart the game or exit. The Kenny button moves randomly within the app screen boundaries in every 250 milliseconds. The app also shows the current time left and the user's score on the screen. The code uses Java and Android Studio to build the app.
